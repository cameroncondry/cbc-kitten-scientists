Kitten Scientists (KS) is a simple automation script for the complex [Kittens Game](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/).

## Basic Usage

Create the following JavaScript bookmarklet (create a new bookmark and past this as the URL):

    javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://rawgit.com/cameroncondry/cbc-kitten-scientists/master/kitten-scientists.user.js';d.body.appendChild(s);})();

### Alternative Installation

You can also permanently install Kitten Scientists with a userscript manager.

- On **Firefox**, you'd want to use [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
- On **Chrome** and **Opera**, you'd want to use [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

Now simply [open the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cameroncondry/cbc-kitten-scientists/master/kitten-scientists.user.js) and you should be prompted to install it. 

## Functionality

- Several UI adjustments (depending on selected theme).
- Automates:
    - Building
    - Crafting
    - Hunting
    - Praising
    - Holding festivals

### Building

By default, buildings are built if their required resources are at 75% of their storage capacity. For space structures,
the default threshold is 95%.

### Crafting

Craftable resources are crafted when the resources required for the craft are at 95% of their storage capacity.
 
Additionally, you can set a *consumption rate* (60% by default). This defines how much of the available resources can be
used for crafting.

### Trading

Trades happen when the traded resource is at 95% of the storage capacity. The trades are optimized to only happen during
seasons when the trade is most effective.

### Hunting

Hunts when catpower is at 95% capacity and builds luxury items before the hunt is sent.

### Praising

Praises when faith is at 99% capacity.

### Game Log

Automatically observes astronomical events.
